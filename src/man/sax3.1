.SH DESCRIPTION

SaX3 provides a Graphical Utility for editing xorg.conf.d in a simplified
manner so that users do not undergo the pain to modify configuration files. X
currently, has automatic configuration but sometimes these configurations have
to be manually overriden, in such cases SaX3 can be a useful tool.
